- [**Assignment 2**](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/tree/main/ComputerNetworks/Assignment2) - Java based flow forwarding protocol. Demonstrated with Docker containers.

CSU34011 - Symbolic Programming:

- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/blob/main/SymbolicProgramming/A1) - Prolog exercises.

- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/blob/main/SymbolicProgramming/A2) - continued Prolog exercises.

CSU34016 - Functional Programming:

- [Exercises 0-4](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/tree/main/FunctionalProgramming) - Fundamental Haskell exercises.

CSU33012 - Software Engineering:

- [Software Engineer Bio](https://github.com/seangaff/software-engineer-bio) - Short biography of Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple and the designer of their early devices, which brought personal computing to the mainstream.

- [Measuring Engineering Report](https://github.com/seangaff/measuring-engineering-report) - Assesing the various ways in which software engineering and engineers can be measured, and the pros and cons of each.

- [**Github Metric Visualization**](https://github.com/seangaff/github-metric-visualization) - React/Javascript app that visualizes various metrics of a Github repository.

## Semester Two Modules

CSU33032 - Advanced Computer Networks:

- [Web Proxy Server](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/tree/main/AdvancedComputerNetworks/WebProxyServer) - CLI based web proxy server written in Python, handles requests, responses and caching.Console allows for blocking and unblocking of specified domains.

- [**Secure Social Media**](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/tree/main/AdvancedComputerNetworks/secure-social-media) - Secure chat application built with React and Firebase. All messages are encrypted using a public RSA key before being published to the database. The private decryption key is securely distributed to trusted users so that they can read messages. Private keys are encryped with the users UID and AES encryption in the Firestore database.

CSU33061 - Artificial Intelligence I:

- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/blob/main/ArtificialIntelligence/A1/a1.txt) - Prolog implementation of A\* search algorithm.

- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/tree/main/ArtificialIntelligence/A2) - Q-Learning exercises in Python.

CSU34041 - Information Mangement II:

- [MySQL Database Project](https://github.com/seangaff/ThirdYear/tree/main/InformationMangement2/Project) - Example database and queries modeling a fictional set of Chess Tournaments.

CSU33012 Software Engineering Project II:

- [**Legislation Visualization Project**](https://github.com/SWENG-Group-13/legislation-visualization) - Web application for visualization of legislation in the Irish Oireachtas. Built with React, Node.js, Express, and D3.js. Assists with the understanding of when the Oireachtas is most productive, and the many relationships between legislators, political parties, and indivudal bills.
